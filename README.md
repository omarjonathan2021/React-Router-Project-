# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Details 
In this checkpoint, We are going to use the movie app we have created in the [previous Checkpoint](https://github.com/omarjonathan2021/Movie-App-Project)
 and afterward, we will use the router library to route our views.

Our task is to add a description and the trailer link (embed video link) to the object movie.
- Every time I click on a movie card, it will take me to the movie description and trailer page.
- In the description page, I can navigate back to the home page.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
